## 1. Navigate to Account Settings
- The user logs into their account.
- The user goes to their **Account Settings** or **Profile** section, typically found in a dropdown menu or sidebar.

## 2. Locate the Delete Account Option
- Within the Account Settings, the user finds the **Delete Account** option.
  - This option might be under sections like **Privacy**, **Security**, or **Account Management**.
  - Often, the Delete Account button is labeled clearly and may be highlighted to indicate its significance.

## 3. Review Deletion Information
- When the user selects **Delete Account**, they may be shown information about the deletion process, including:
  - **Data loss**: A warning that account deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.
  - **Associated data**: Information on what data will be deleted, such as personal information, posts, and saved preferences.

## 4. Confirm Identity (if required)
- For security, the user might need to **re-enter their password** or **complete two-factor authentication (2FA)**.
- Some systems may also send a **confirmation email** or SMS to verify that the account owner initiated the deletion.

## 5. Final Confirmation
- After verifying their identity, the user is asked for final confirmation.
  - A prompt or modal may display a message like "Are you sure you want to delete your account? This action cannot be undone."
  - The user must select **Confirm** or **Delete** to proceed.

## 6. Account Deletion Process
- Upon confirmation:
  - The account is permanently deleted, along with all associated data.
  - The user may see a **confirmation message** stating that the account deletion was successful.
  - Some systems might retain the data temporarily (e.g., 30 days) in case of reactivation, but this varies by service.

## 7. Redirect to Home Page
- After the account is deleted, the user is usually **logged out** and redirected to the applicationâ€™s home page or login page.

## 8. Optional: Confirmation Email
- Some services may send a final **confirmation email** to notify the user that their account has been deleted successfully.

---

> **Note:** Account deletion is typically irreversible. Make sure users are fully informed before they confirm deletion.
